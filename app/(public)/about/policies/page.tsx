            information or to any other communication you initiate. This includes accessing your account 
            to address technical support requests. For this purpose, we may send you, for example, 
            notifications or emails about the performance of our Service, security, payment transactions, 
            notices regarding our Terms and Conditions of User this Privacy Policy.

            </p>
            <p>
            We communicate with you, for example, by push notifications or in the chat. As a result, you 
            may, for example, receive a notification whether on the Website or via email that you received 
            a new message on eDuuka. To opt-out of receiving push notifications, you need to change the 
            settings on your browser or mobile device. To opt-out of a certain type of emails, you need 
            to follow unsubscribe link located in the footer of the email by contacting our support team at 
            support@eduuka.com, or in your profile setting.
            </p>

            The services that we use for these purposes may collect data concerning the date and time when 
            the message was viewed by our users, as well as when they interacted with it, such 
            as by clicking on links included in the message.

            innovate, plan, design, and develop eDuuka and our new products. We also use such data for 
            statistical analysis purposes, to test and improve our offers. This enables us to better 
            understand what features and sections of eDuuka our users like more, what categories of users 
            use our Service. As a consequence, we often decide how to improve eDuuka based on the results 
            obtained from this processing. For example, if we discover that the Jobs section is not as 
            popular as others, we may focus on improving it.
            </p>
            <p>
